4. A woman was carrying a basket of eggs to market when a passer-by bumped
her. She dropped the basket and all the eggs broke. The passer-by, wishing
to pay for her loss, asked, 'How many eggs were in your basket?' 'I don't
remember exactly,' the woman replied, 'but I do recall that whether I divided
the eggs by 2,3,4,5 or 6 there was always one egg left over. When I took
the eggs out in groups of seven, I emptied the basket.' Write an eclipse
constraint program to find the least possible number of eggs.
