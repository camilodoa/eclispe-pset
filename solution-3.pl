/* Question 3 */

/*
Prompt:
The nine digits 1-9 are used to form one three-digit and three two-digit
numbers so that the product of the three digit number and the first two-digit
number is the same as the product of the second and third two-digit
numbers. E.g. 158 multiplied by 23 is 3,634, and 79 multiplied by 46 is also
3,634. Write an eclipse program to find all such arrangements of digits, and
one that will find the arrangement with the largest product. (Hint:
maximizing X is the same as minimizing -X)
